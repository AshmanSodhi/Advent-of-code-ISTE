for the First part:
first the report line is checked if its increasing or decreasing , if its neither, then its UNSAFE
else SAFE and count is increased by 1 given the difference between 1 and 3 between each element

for the Second part:
we create a new line everytime by removing each element once , if removal of one of the elements results in SAFE report ,
then count is increased by 1
